# Memristor-based Custom Deep Spiking Neural Network

## üß† Description
This project implements a custom deep Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that leverages memristor characteristics for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. The network is designed to mimic biological neural systems using a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) for learning. Memristors are used to simulate synaptic weights, enabling low-power and scalable hardware implementations. The project includes scripts to train and test the SNN on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition, along with utilities for data handling and visualization.

## üöÄ Features
- **Memristor-based Synapses**: Simulates synaptic weights using a memristor model for energy-efficient computing.
- **LIF Neuron Model**: Implements Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons for spiking behavior.
- **STDP Learning**: Uses Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for unsupervised learning.
- **MNIST Classification**: Trains and tests the SNN on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools to visualize network activity and performance metrics.
- **Modular Design**: Separates memristor, neuron, network, data handling, and visualization logic into distinct modules.
